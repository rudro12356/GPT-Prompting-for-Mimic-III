Prescription Recommendation and Mortality Prediction using GPT-3.5

üåü Overview

This project leverages GPT-3.5, accessed via the OpenAI API, for medical tasks such as prescription recommendation and mortality prediction. By combining the power of PyHealth for medical data processing with GPT-3.5‚Äôs natural language understanding, the project demonstrates a novel approach to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making using the MIMIC-III dataset.

üß† Project Goals
	1.	Prescription Recommendation: Generate tailored prescription suggestions based on patient medical records.
	2.	Mortality Prediction: Evaluate mortality risks using clinical notes and structured patient data.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI API: Accessed GPT-3.5 for natural language processing tasks.
	‚Ä¢	PyHealth: Streamlined handling of MIMIC-III data for preprocessing and feature extraction.
	‚Ä¢	MIMIC-III Dataset: A publicly available, de-identified clinical dataset for critical care research.
	‚Ä¢	Python: Utilized for data manipulation, integration, and API communication.
	‚Ä¢	Prompt Engineering: Designed prompts to optimize GPT-3.5 outputs for medical tasks.

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. Data Processing with PyHealth
	‚Ä¢	Extracted and preprocessed structured patient records, including clinical notes, lab values, and demographic information, using PyHealth.
	‚Ä¢	Mapped patient data into formats suitable for GPT-3.5 querying.

2. Prompt Engineering
	‚Ä¢	Designed task-specific prompts:
	‚Ä¢	Prescription Recommendation: Input patient medical summaries to retrieve medication suggestions.
	‚Ä¢	Mortality Prediction: Provide structured patient data and clinical notes to assess mortality risks.

3. Model Integration
	‚Ä¢	Combined PyHealth‚Äôs preprocessing pipeline with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 to deliver predictions:
	‚Ä¢	Batch processing for multiple patient records.
	‚Ä¢	Controlled response generation with structured prompts.

üß™ Results
	‚Ä¢	For both the tasks, the model does not seem to exceed or perform really well. This project was a scratch on the surface and more time needs to be put into exploring the usage of LLMs in the field of healthcare.

üöÄ Future Directions
	‚Ä¢	Fine-Tuning: Explore integrating domain-specific fine-tuning of GPT-3.5 for better performance on clinical tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Scalability: Expand the use of PyHealth to include larger datasets for broader validation.
	‚Ä¢	Ethical Considerations: Ensure outputs meet ethical standards in medical AI applications, including fairness and bias mitigation.
